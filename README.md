# Travel Insurance Prediction
This project is a machine learning-based approach to predict travel insurance purchases by customers Travel insurance is a type of coverage that provides financial protection against unexpected events while traveling abroad. This product is usually sold by travel agents and online insurers. The main goal of this project is to predict the purchase intent of this type of insurance based on user data.  The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will purchase travel insurance. This can be used to improve the customer experience by providing personalized offers and improving conversion rates.

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. Data analysis and feature engineering

2. Machine learning model evaluation

## Features
* Spearheaded the development of a cutting-edge machine learning model to predict travel insurance purchases by customers, leveraging data analysis and feature engineering techniques.
* Implemented Python-based statistical inference techniques to uncover meaningful correlations between variables in the travel insurance dataset, thereby gaining valuable insights into customer purchase behavior.
* Explored various machine learning classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNN, AdaBoost Classifier)  and evaluated their performance to select the most suitable model for predicting travel insurance purchase intent achieving an accuracy of 78%.
