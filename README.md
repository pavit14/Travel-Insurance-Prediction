# Travel Insurance Prediction
This project is a machine learning-based approach to predict travel insurance purchases by customers Travel insurance is a type of coverage that provides financial protection against unexpected events while traveling abroad. This product is usually sold by travel agents and online insurers. The main goal of this project is to predict the purchase intent of this type of insurance based on user data.  The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will purchase travel insurance. This can be used to improve the customer experience by providing personalized offers and improving conversion rates.

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. Data analysis and feature engineering

2. Machine learning model evaluation

## Features
* Utilized Python to apply statistical inference techniques to establish correlations between variables, performed feature engineering to develop new variables.
* Analyzed various classification models, performed hyperparameter tuning to enhance the accuracy of the target variable, and achieved an accuracy rate of 78% to demonstrate expertise in data modeling and analysis.
